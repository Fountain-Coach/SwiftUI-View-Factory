# ðŸ§  codex/

This folder contains Codex task descriptions.

Each `.codex.yml` file describes a high-level reasoning goal for Codex agents, like:

- Bootstrapping a SwiftUI app from a layout
- Regenerating views from new mockups
- Scaffolding clients from OpenAPI specs

Codex runners will interpret these files, invoke CLI tools, and write SwiftUI, Python, or other source artifacts in response.
